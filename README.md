Concept	Description

Structure
Each process stores PID, arrival time, burst time, turnaround, waiting, and response times.

FCFS	
Sorts by arrival time â†’ runs in order of arrival.

SJF	
At each step, picks the available process with the shortest burst time (non-preemptive).

Gantt Chart	
Displays the order in which processes are executed.

Turnaround Time (TAT)	
TAT = Completion Time - Arrival Time

Waiting Time (WT)	
WT = TAT - Burst Time (same as Response Time for non-preemptive)

Response Time (RT)	
Time from arrival until first CPU execution (same as WT here).
